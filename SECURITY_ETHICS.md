## 🛡️ Responsible Disclosure

### What is Responsible Disclosure?

Responsible disclosure is the practice of reporting security vulnerabilities to the affected organization before making them public.

### Steps for Responsible Disclosure

**1. Discovery**
- Document the vulnerability thoroughly
- Test in authorized environment only
- Gather proof of concept

**2. Initial Contact**
- Contact organization's security team
- Provide clear, professional report
- Give reasonable time to respond

**3. Coordination**
- Work with security team
- Provide additional details if needed
- Respect agreed timelines

**4. Resolution**
- Allow time for patch development
- Verify fix if requested
- Coordinate public disclosure

**5. Public Disclosure**
- Only after fix is deployed
- Credit organization's cooperation
- Share lessons learned

### Typical Disclosure Timeline

- **Day 0:** Vulnerability discovered
- **Day 1-7:** Initial report to organization
- **Day 7-14:** Acknowledgment and validation
- **Day 14-90:** Development and testing of fix
- **Day 90+:** Public disclosure (if fixed)
